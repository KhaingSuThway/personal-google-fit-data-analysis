## Data Analyzing Project on Personal Google Fit Data

Welcome to my personal fitness journey with Google Fit! 🏃‍♀️📊 In this project, I'll take you through a captivating exploratory data analysis (EDA) of my very own fitness activity recorded on Google Fit. Together, we'll unlock valuable insights and make some exciting observations by applying powerful visualizations to my fitness data.

### Motivation 💪🚀

Life can get challenging, and during my graduate study journey, I faced my fair share of struggles - anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation. I also noticed a significant weight gain and experienced moments of rapid heart rate during sleep. Determined to take control of my well-being, I embarked on a personal mission to track myself and gain a deeper understanding of my fitness habits. This data analysis project is not just about numbers; it's about personal growth and transformation.

### The Quest for Better Insights 💡

Equipped with my trusty Amazfit GTS 4 mini, I synced my activity data to Google Fit through the Zepp application. While the fitness experience with the watch was excellent, the insights provided felt somewhat lackluster. My data analyst instincts kicked in, and I set out on a quest to discover better ways to gain meaningful insights from my daily fitness activity. That's when I stumbled upon Google Takeout - a treasure trove of personal data waiting to be explored!

### A Personal Data Adventure 🚀🗺️

Get ready to join me on an exhilarating data adventure like no other! 🌟 Armed with my trusty Amazfit GTS 4 mini and the power of Google Fit, I've embarked on an epic quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within my fitness data. While some data, like heart rate, may be missing due to my new journey with this watch, fear not! We'll work our magic with the treasure trove of data from Google Takeout, trying our best to extract meaningful insights and fascinating discoveries.

As I sync my activity data through the Zepp application, I can't help but feel a surge of excitement.
